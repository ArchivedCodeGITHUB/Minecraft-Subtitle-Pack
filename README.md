### Unsure about the different selections?
You can select from 5 different subtitle packs, each offering a unique style! The first option is the "New Default" pack, which features logos in the post-1.17 style. The second option is the "Default" pack, which includes subtitles in the pre-1.18 style. The third option is the "Old" pack, which features logos in the alpha/beta style (still in beta). The fourth option is the "Parody Logos" pack, and the last option is the "Custom Headings" pack. Choose the subtitle pack that best suits your preferences!

### Installation:
Installing the pack will include a resource pack. To use this resource pack, apply it in a world or global resource packs in settings. Click the gear icon and scroll through the slider to change the logo.

Once you have downloaded the texture pack, click the **.mcpack** file, which should automatically direct you to the Minecraft app.

If for some reason the __.mcpack__ file is unable to import into your Minecraft game, you can download the **.zip** file. To use this **.zip** file, go into your file manager app (your system files) and unzip the **.zip** file to turn it into a normal folder. Once those steps are complete, place the folder in the location of the resource_packs folder. To locate this folder, follow the folder sequence: Minecraft > games > com.mojang > resource_packs.
